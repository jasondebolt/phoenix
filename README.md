# The Phoenix Project

## To create a new Phoenix starter application
- Create a shell script like the "create_phoenix_react_project.sh" file
- Execute the shell script to create an empty CodeCommit repo, ECR Repo, etc.
- Clone the repo locally and add your starter project files to it.
- Push your changes and watch the pipeline go!
- Iterate on the starter project until it works. Add buildspec.yml files, etc.
- When stable, create a Jenkins job under the "Phoenix" tab to generate named projects from your starter project.
